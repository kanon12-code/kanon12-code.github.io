        <p>I'm a passionate Data Analyst, currently immersed myself in an intensive data analytics program at Masterschool, solidifying my dedication to growing in this dynamic field. I am eager to apply my analytical, strategic, and interpersonal skills to drive growth in a new team.

How My Previous Experience Translated to Data Analysis üíª
As a joint-degree master's student in social science across multiple European universities, I gained a profound experience in research and analysis. After that, I started working as the first HR specialist at a Berlin-based multicultural startup company, whose work encompasses data audits, privacy updates, employee rights, recruitment, and employee performance analysis.

I chose to pursue data analytics out of a desire to challenge myself and stay at the forefront of modern business trends. I‚Äôm eagerly exploring opportunities in Germany's vibrant data analysis landscape to apply my unique mix of education and experience.

My Key Skills üìù
I have technical skills in SQL, Tableau, Spreadsheet and Python. I am also familiar with programs like Slack, Miro, Zoom, Google Drive, ERP System (DATEV), HRMS (Personio).

I'm thrilled to connect with like-minded professionals and organizations, as well as to leverage my background in HR and BPO marketing, and my new data analysis skills to make data-driven decisions that will grow your business.</p>
